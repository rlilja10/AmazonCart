# AmazonCart
Submits user entries for books and adds to table that can add and remove rows with buttons.

# Running
Open cart.html file using browser, find a Books to Scrape product, copy and paste link with Name and product name or alias, and click Add button to add to cart. Remove button removes from cart. Total price will automatically calculate based on what's in the cart.

Edit: Due to security reasons, Amazon.com could not be reliably scraped for product price or picture. I switched to using the Books to Scrape website.
